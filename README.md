# Staking Pool Mishaps
## Objective
I aim to have this document serve as an up-to-date register of every slashing event & rugpull that occurs across the various staking pools taking place on the Ethereum network. 

I intend to update this document on a weekly basis at minimum, but I'll usually check up on these events daily.

If you have any questions for me or know of any (new or old) rugpulls related to staking services that I may be missing, please reach out with the contact information below, or submit a pull request.

For an up-to-date list of all rugpulls, hacks, exploits, etc... taking place on Ethereum and its  sidechains, see this link: [https://github.com/TheSquanch-147/Rugpulls-Hacks-Exploits-List](https://github.com/TheSquanch-147/Rugpulls-Hacks-Exploits-List)
